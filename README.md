# Plum
A darkish GTK theme with purple accents. This theme uses the Arc theme as a base but with different colours. I generated this theme using Oomox.

# Installation
Simply clone this repo into `~/.themes` and pick the GTK theme from GNOME Tweaks or whatever your DE uses. Alternatively you can put it in `/usr/share/themes` but you don't get Flatpak support then.

```bash
cd ~/.themes && git clone https://github.com/digiberk/plum.git
```
